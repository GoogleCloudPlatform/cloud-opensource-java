# temurin-testing

This Terraform configuration installs Temurin on a matrix of GCE machine types and OS boot images.
The tests are split into three batches to prevent hitting standard compute quotas, and are enabled
using three boolean input variables:

* `enable_arm`: Performs testing on `arm_machine_types` x `arm_boot_images`
* `enable_linux`: Performs testing on `x86_machine_types` x `x86_boot_images`
* `enable_windows`: Performs testing on `x86_machine_types` x `x86_windows_boot_images`

Defaults for the above values are found in `variables.tf`.

## Snippet Region Tags

The `startup.sh` and `startup.ps1` files have region tags used to identify the boundaries of the
snippets to include in Temurin installation documentation.

## Workflow

1. Create a file named `private.auto.tfvars` in this folder with contents:
   ```shell
   user_email = "[gcloud account email]"
   project_id = "[gcp project id]"
   bucket     = "[cloud storage bucket id for results]"
   ```

2. Invoke the tests
    * To invoke the full test suite, execute `terraform init`, then `./test-all.sh`
    * To invoke a single test batch, modify `inputs.auto.tfvars` to enable one batch, then execute
      `terraform apply`. To destroy these resources later, set the batch variable back
      to false and execute `terraform apply` again.cd
        * (Optional) Review the input matrix for the batch you've enabled in `variables.tf`.

3. (Parsing Results) Test results are uploaded to the specified GCS bucket at
   `gs://[BUCKET]/[TIMESTAMP]/[MACHINE TYPE]` and full logs are available
   at `gs://[BUCKET]/[TIMESTAMP]/logs`.

4. (Debugging) To SSH into a created VM instance:
    * Find the VM instance name by either navigating to
      https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances, or by looking at Terraform's console
      output.
        * Example Terraform output:
          ```
          google_compute_instance.default["n2-standard-2-centos-stream-8"]: Creation complete after 14s [id=projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE_ID/instances/n2-standard-2-centos-stream-8]
          ```
          Where `n2-standard-2-centos-stream-8` is the VM instance name.
    * Invoke the `connect.sh` helper script with the VM instance name:
      ```shell
      ./connect.sh [VM_INSTANCE_NAME]
      ```
      Example:
      ```shell
      ./connect.sh n2-standard-2-centos-stream-8
      ```
