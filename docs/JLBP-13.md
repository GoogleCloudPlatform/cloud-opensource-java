[JLBP-13] Quickly remove references to deprecated features in dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This best practice refers to code that *uses* deprecated functionality from
  another library or the JDK, not to the deprecated functionality itself.
  - It does not apply to usage of deprecated features within a library.
- The earlier you remove usages of external deprecated functionality, the
  more versions of your product will work with your dependency once the
  deprecated features are fully deleted or hidden in the dependency.
  - For example, api-common-java 1.6.0 refers to `Futures.transform(ListenableFuture, Function)`
    in Guava, which was deprecated in 19.0 and removed in 26.0. In
    api-common-java 1.7, the code was changed to instead call
    `Futures.transform(ListenableFuture, Function, Executor)`,
    which is not deprecated. The oldest version of api-common-java that
    can be used with Guava 26.0 or later is 1.7.0, because 1.6.0 and earlier
    refer to a deleted method. If api-common-java had moved to the new
    method even earlier (for example, if this had been done in 1.0.0), then
    more versions of api-common-java would be compatible with Guava 26.0 and
    later (1.0.0+ instead of 1.7.0+), making it easier to find compatible
    combinations of versions.
