# [JLBP-11] Stay up to date with compatible dependencies

Recommendation: Release a new version of your library 
no later than 6 weeks after any of your dependencies
releases a version that is higher than the one your library depends on.

Time is an important factor (not just how many versions behind) because
having the ecosystem generally up to date at each point in time results in
ecosystem "snapshots" that are more consistent, and more likely to have
compatibility across the board.

If your library does not have the investment necessary to keep 
dependencies up to date, advise consumers to move to a library that is 
kept more up to date.
