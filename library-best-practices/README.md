Java Library Best Practices
---------------------------

The Java Library Best Practices are a collection of practices that we believe
will minimize problems for consumers of interconnected Java libraries.  These
practices come from decades of aggregated experience in maintaining open source
Java libraries and are informed by many hard-earned lessons from mistakes that
have been made. We have found that following these best practices will result in
higher quality Java libraries with fewer diamond dependency conflicts and other
kinds of problems. The list is open-ended, so new ones may be added from time to
time.

- [JLBP-1](JLBP-1.md): Minimize dependencies
- [JLBP-2](JLBP-2.md): Minimize API surface
- [JLBP-3](JLBP-3.md): Use Semantic versioning
- [JLBP-4](JLBP-4.md): Avoid dependencies on unstable libraries and features
- [JLBP-5](JLBP-5.md): Avoid dependencies that overlap classes with other
  dependencies
- [JLBP-6](JLBP-6.md): Package and artifact renaming rules
