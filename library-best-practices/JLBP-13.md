[JLBP-13] Remove references to deprecated features quickly
----------------------------------------------------------

- This best practice refers to code that *uses* deprecated functionality, not to
  the deprecated functionality itself.
- The earlier you remove references to deprecated functionality, the more
  versions of your product will work with your dependency once the deprecated
  features are fully deleted.
