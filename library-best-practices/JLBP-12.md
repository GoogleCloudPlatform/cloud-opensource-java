[JLBP-12] Make level of support and level of API stability clear
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Surface stability should be clearly described.
- Feedback mechanisms should be outlined (for example, file an issue).
- Clearly describe when a library is abandoned.
- Clearly label 0.x libraries as unstable (as in, they can experience
  breakages and are not recommended for production use).
