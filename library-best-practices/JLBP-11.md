[JLBP-11] Stay up to date with compatible dependencies
------------------------------------------------------

- Recommendation: Release no later than 6 weeks after any of your dependencies
  releases a version that is higher than the one your library depends on.
  - Time is an important factor (not just how many versions behind) because
    having the ecosystem generally up to date at each point in time results in
    ecosystem "snapshots" that are more consistent, and more likely to have
    compatibility across the board.
- If your library does not have the investment necessary to keep up to date with
  dependencies, advise consumers to move to a library that is kept more up to
  date.
