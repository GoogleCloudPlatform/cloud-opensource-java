[JLBP-11] Frequent release cadence for non-breaking changes
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Keep compatible dependencies up-to-date.
- Recommendation: Perform a release at least once every 6-weeks.
  - Don't be more than 6 weeks out of date with your dependencies.
  - Your release cadence can be longer if your dependencies don't change.
